    Hello, my name is Jake Snitily, and I am a motivated and passionate student at Gonzaga University pursuing a B.S in Computer Science with a
    concentration in Cyber Security. I have a love for all things problem solving, and I excel when I'm directing
    projects and managing resources to ensure the success of a team. I am a long-time rock climber and skiier, and
    I love to be outdoors. Theres no better day to me, than a day I can completely unplug and be in remote nature.
